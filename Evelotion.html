    <h1>The Evelotion Of Cybersecurity</h1>
    <p>
      Networked computer systems and the data they store and transmit have been
      the target of threats and attacks ever since the early days of the
      internet. As digital systems have become ubiquitous in our professional
      and personal lives — including the meteoric rise of mobile devices, the
      proliferation of social media and the rapid expansion of connectivity —
      cyberattacks have become persistent risks that require vigilance, ongoing
      analysis and pre-emptive procedures.

      Today, ransomware, fileless malware and nation-state attacks dominate the
      cybersecurity conversation, one that has expanded beyond IT teams to
      involve the entire C-suite. Companies are shifting from previously
      reactive stances to more proactive ones. Real-time threat analysis, breach
      detection and predictive modeling all signal a significant shift away from
      information security toward intelligent security.

      pioneers,including Finjan Inc., an early innovator in internet security
      that has generated more than $350 million in income from licensing its
      intellectual property; AVG Technologies; CUPP Cybersecurity; and
      Centripetal Networks, whose RuleGate technology was named one of the top
      16 cyber technologies for 2017 by an independent panel of the world’s
      premier cyber experts.
