      <dt><strong>Phishing</strong></dt>
      &nbsp;
      <dd>
        Phishing is the most common hacking technique. All of our inboxes and
        text messaging apps are filled with phishing messages daily.These are
        messages that are disguised as either as an organization (Amazon,
        Netflix, etc.) or a person that you trust and will, in most cases, tell
        a story to trick you into clicking on a link or opening an
        attachment.Typically they will:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Inform you that someone has been trying to log into your website and
            you should update your credentials
          </li>
          <li>
            Claim that there’s a problem with your account or your payment
            information
          </li>
          <li>Ask you to confirm some personal information</li>
          <li>Include a fake invoice</li>
          <li>
            Inform you that you are eligible to register for a state or federal
            refund
          </li>
          <li>Offer you free stuff</li>
          <li>Sent from one of your friends with an obscure link</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>Bait and Switch Attack</strong></dt>
      &nbsp;
      <dd>
        Using trusted marketing methods such as paid-for advertising on
        websites, attackers can trick you into visiting malicious sites. When
        websites sell advertising space, it can be purchased by rogue attackers.
        The bona fide advertisement can be replaced with a ‘bad’ link that can
        be used to download malware, lock up your browser, or compromise your
        systems. Alternatively, the advertisement may link to a legitimate
        website, but it will be programmed to redirect you to a harmful site.
      </dd>
      &nbsp;
      <dt><strong>Key Logger</strong></dt>
      &nbsp;
      <dd>
        A key logger is a small piece of software that, when downloaded into
        your computer, will record every keystroke. The key logger will capture
        every keystroke on the keyboard, every username, password and credit
        card number, etc., exposing all of your data and personal information.
      </dd>
      &nbsp;
      <dt><strong>Denial of Service (DoS\DDoS) Attacks</strong></dt>
      &nbsp;
      <dd>
        A Denial of Service attack is a hacking technique designed to flood your
        web server with a myriad of requests to the point that it overloads the
        web server resulting in a website crash. To do this, hackers will deploy
        botnets or zombie computers that have a single task, flood your web site
        with data requests.
      </dd>
      &nbsp;
      <dt><strong>ClickJacking Attacks</strong></dt>
      &nbsp;
      <dd>
        This method tricks you into clicking on something different from what
        you thought you were clicking. The clickjacking element could be a
        button on a web page that, when clicked, performs another function,
        allowing others to take control of the computer. The host website may
        not be aware of the existence of the clickjacking element.
      </dd>
      &nbsp;
      <dt><strong>Fake W.A.P.</strong></dt>
      &nbsp;
      <dd>
        A hacker can use software to impersonate a wireless access point
        (W.A.P.), which can connect to the ‘official’ public place W.A.P. that
        you are using. Once you get connected to the fake W.A.P., a hacker can
        access your data. To fool you, the hacker will give the fake W.A.P. an
        apparent genuine name such as ’T.F. Green Aiport Free WiFi.
      </dd>
      &nbsp;
      <dt><strong>Cookie Theft</strong></dt>
      &nbsp;
      <dd>
        The cookies in your web browsers (Chrome, Safari, etc.) store personal
        data such as browsing history, username, and passwords for different
        sites we access. Hackers will send I.P. (data) packets that pass through
        your computer, and they can do that if the website you are browsing
        doesn’t have an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate. Websites that
        begin with HTTPS:// are secure, whereas sites that start with HTTP://
        (no ‘S’) do not have SSL and are NOT considered secure.
      </dd>
      &nbsp;
      <dt><strong>Viruses and Trojans</strong></dt>
      &nbsp;
      <dd>
        Viruses or Trojans are malicious software programs that, when installed
        on your computer, will send your data to the hacker. They can also lock
        your files, spread to all the computers connected to your network, and
        perform many other nasty actions.
