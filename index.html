    <p class="TheBeginning">
      Cryptography, or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for
      secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries.
      More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols
      that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages.
      various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data
      integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern
      cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the
      disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering,
      communication science, and physics. Applications of cryptography include
      electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies,
      computer passwords, and military communications.

    <p class="NetworkSecurity">
      Today's network architecture is complex and is faced with a threat
      environment that is always changing and attackers that are always trying
      to find and exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can exist in a
      broad number of areas, including devices, data, applications, users and
      locations. For this reason, there are many network security management
      tools and applications in use today that address individual threats and
      exploits and also regulatory non-compliance. When just a few minutes of
      downtime can cause widespread disruption and massive damage to an
      organization's bottom line and reputation, it is essential that these
      protection measures are in place. Get top rated network. Here is

    <h2>Cyber Security Specialist</h2>
    <p>
      Cyber Security Specialist is responsible for providing security during the
      development stages of software systems, networks and data centers. The
      professionals have to search for vulnerabilities and risks in hardware and
      software. They manage and monitor any attacks and intrusions. The Security
      Specialist has to recognize the potential threat or attempted breach by
      closing off the security vulnerability. They build firewalls into network
      infrastructure. Here are

    <h2>The Evolution Of Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
      Fortunately, cybersecurity has evolved at break-neck speed and shows no
      signs of slowing down. But before we look too far into the future, itâ€™s
      worth having a look at the past. By understanding some of the major
      turning points in cybersecurity history, we can better respond when a more
      advanced attack strikes today. Here is
