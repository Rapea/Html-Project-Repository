    <p class="TheBeginning_2">
      There are many layers to consider when addressing network security across
      an organization. Attacks can happen at any layer in the network security
      layers model, so your network security hardware, software and policies
      must be designed to address each area. Network security typically consists
      of three different controls: physical, technical and administrative. Here
      is a brief description of the different types of network security and how
      each control works.
    </p>
    <h3 class="PhysicalN">Physical Network Security</h3>
    <p class="PhysicalNs">
      Physical security controls are designed to prevent unauthorized personnel
      from gaining physical access to network components such as routers,
      cabling cupboards and so on. Controlled access, such as locks, biometric
      authentication and other devices, is essential in any organization.
    </p>
    <h3 class="TechnicalN">Technical Network Security</h3>
    <p class="TechnicalNs">
      Technical security controls protect data that is stored on the network or
      which is in transit across, into or out of the network. Protection is
      twofold; it needs to protect data and systems from unauthorized personnel,
      and it also needs to protect against malicious activities from employees.
    </p>
    <h3 class="AdministrativeN">Administrative Network Security</h3>
    <p class="AdministrativeNs">
      Administrative security controls consist of security policies and
      processes that control user behavior, including how users are
      authenticated, their level of access and also how IT staff members
      implement changes to the infrastructure.

    <p class="afterType">
      We have talked about the different types of network security controls. Now
      let's take a look at some of the different ways you can secure your
      network.

      <li>Antivirus and Antimalware Software</li>
      <li>Firewall Protection</li>
      <li>Virtual Private Networks</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Network Access Control</h4>
    <p>
      To ensure that potential attackers cannot infiltrate your network,
      comprehensive access control policies need to be in place for both users
      and devices. Network access control (NAC) can be set at the most granular
      level. For example, you could grant administrators full access to the
      network but deny access to specific confidential folders or prevent their
      personal devices from joining the network.
    </p>
    <h4>Antivirus and Antimalware Software</h4>
    <p>
      Antivirus and antimalware software protect an organization from a range of
      malicious software, including viruses, ransomware, worms and trojans. The
      best software not only scans files upon entry to the network but
      continuously scans and tracks files.
    </p>
    <h4>Firewall Protection</h4>
    <p>
      Firewalls, as their name suggests, act as a barrier between the untrusted
      external networks and your trusted internal network. Administrators
      typically configure a set of defined rules that blocks or permits traffic
      onto the network. For example, Forcepoint's Next Generation Firewall
      (NGFW) offers seamless and centrally managed control of network traffic,
      whether it is physical, virtual or in the cloud.
    </p>
    <h4>Virtual Private Networks</h4>
    <p>
      Virtual private networks (VPNs) create a connection to the network from
      another endpoint or site. For example, users working from home would
      typically connect to the organization's network over a VPN. Data between
      the two points is encrypted and the user would need to authenticate to
      allow communication between their device and the network. Forcepoint's
      Secure Enterprise SD-WAN allows organizations to quickly create VPNs using
      drag-and-drop and to protect all locations with our Next Generation
      Firewall solution.
